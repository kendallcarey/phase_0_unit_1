// I paired  on this challenge.

//1. Kris Shanks
//2. Kendall Carey




// Pseudocode
// var secretNumber is 12
// var password is "password"
// var allowedIn is false
// members is an array with 'John', 'Kris', and 'Kendall'
//push 'Mary' into the array


// __________________________________________
// Write your code below.
var secretNumber = 12;
var password = "password";
var allowedIn = false;
members = ['John'];





// __________________________________________
// Refactored Code: Include a refactored version (or justification of your original code) here. 
var secretNumber=7;
var password="just open the door";
members = ['John', 'Kris', 'Kendall'];
members.push('Mary');
//tried member=new.Array but received an error message. It worked without it.
//tried the members array with and without var, both worked fine.
//Previously, just edited code to be correct and then rewrote everything out 
//and pushed 'Mary' into the array rather than just edit previous code.



// __________________________________________
// Reflection: Use the reflection guidelines to write a reflection here. 
// 
// We both found this exercise rather easy. We didn't run into any problems.
// We both enjoyed the challenge and feel confident about the learning objectives.
// The process of test driven development was more fun with a partner.
// 
// I loved working with Kris. He is very kind and I look forward to working with him again.
//
